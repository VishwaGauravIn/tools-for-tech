### Branch Organization

Submit all changes directly to the main branch. We donâ€™t use separate branches for development or for upcoming releases. We do our best to keep main in good shape, with all tests passing.

Code that lands in main must be compatible with the latest stable release. It may contain additional features, but no breaking changes. We should be able to release a new minor version from the tip of main at any time.

### Prerequisites
- You have Node installed at v8.0.0+ and Yarn at v1.2.0+.
- You have JDK installed.
- You have gcc installed or are comfortable installing a compiler if needed. Some of our dependencies may require a compilation step. On OS X, the Xcode Command Line Tools will cover this. On Ubuntu, apt-get install build-essential will install the required packages. Similar commands should work on other Linux distros. Windows will require some additional steps, see the node-gyp installation instructions for details.
- You are familiar with Git.

### How to Report Bugs
In order to report bugs, you should create an issue and describe about the bug properly and you can also suggest a way to fix it (in case you know it). You should mention your device details (if possible) so that we can find the fix fast.
